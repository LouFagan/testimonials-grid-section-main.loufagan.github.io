## My process

First I tried to create the page full width first and it didn't work very well so then I started over using mobile first and I think I was better able to get the page to transition better from mobile to full width.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Every project that I tackle I find that I learn more about grid, flexbox and css in general. I enjoyed building this project.

### Continued development

I will keep focusing on flexbox, grid and try to not learn more so that I don't have to use media queries to make the pages.
